# GPPB-2023

Once again I had the pleasure to talk about data visualization, thanks to the **Power Platform Euskadi** group. This time it has been in the **Global Power Platform Bootcamp 2023** where I have been able to talk about techniques to remove noise from our visualizations, using Power BI.

In this repo you will find datasets, demos and slides used in that session (Content in Spanish).
